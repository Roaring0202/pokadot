# Developer Heroes Application Review Criteria and Scoring Matrix Guidelines

This process can be used to evaluate a candidate for Hero status in the program.

## Process

Each candidate is scored on a matrix of 4 areas. These areas encompass the core competencies a hero is expected to have to varying degrees to be part of the program as a Hero. These areas are:

* **Technical expertise**: Do they have technical experience building and shipping code?
* **Community involvement**: Are they active in the Polkadot community?
* **Content creation experience**: Are they technical builders who like teaching other technical builders?
* **Leadership experience**: Do they build community and inspire others to join them?

Each category in the matrix has a maximum score of 10 points thereby totalling a maximal evaluative score of 40 for a Hero candidate. The scoring framework later on should assist the evaluators in providing a reasoned score for each category for the candidate.

Candidates that score in the top 10% should be perceived as strong contenders to be seen as a Hero.

## Scoring Range Interpretation

The scoring matrix is used to determine qualifications for Hero status. A hero is someone with exceptional proficiency across the five areas being evaluated and can serve as a mentor to the rookies in the program. As such, the following range for scoring should set the framework for who is qualified:

*Hero: 21-40 points*

## Evaluation points

- Technical expertise (*up to 10 points*)
    - Demonstrated experience with Rust
    - Open source involvement in building with Polkadot
    - Other technical demonstrations in blockchain and/or open source involvement in Web2 projects
    - Completed blockchain projects with code available to view and see their contribution history
- Community involvement (*up to 10 points*)
    - Participation in Polkadot online forums
    - Participation in on-chain Polkadot voting
    - Attendance at any Polkadot related events, online or in-person
- Content creation experience (*up to 10 points*)
    - Links to blog posts and/or tutorials created and published
    - Recordings of talks delivered at meetups, conferences or other events
- Leadership experience (*up to 10 points*)
    - Lead involvement in any Polkadot related meetups or events?
    - Lead involvement in any tech related meetups generally?
    - Evidence of providing influential thought contributions to discussions on forums or elsewhere
    - Mentorship experience of others in either Polkadot or any other technical community

## Scoring framework

The following guidelines should help guide the evaluators in assigning points to each category in the matrix. 

### Technical Expertise

* **0-2 points**: Experience in programming, but no experience in Rust or Polkadot
* **3-4 points**: Beginning exposure to development with Rust, some minor open-source contributions and a beginning familiarity with Polkadot
* **5-6 points**: Documented evidence on GitHub or elsewhere of contributions towards any Rust project (their own or other), open source involvement with Polkadot that are evident by either completed or WIP projects
* **7-8 points**: A further continuation from the previous scoring tier of documented evidence of contributions towards significant open source projects involving Polkadot. The projects are well documented both in code documentation and with a supporting README and other forms of additional resources
* **9-10 points**: Leadership in open source Rust and Polkadot development of projects with a steady contribution history of the project(s). The projects should demonstrate some form of innovation and creative thought.

### Community Involvement

* **0-2 points**: Minimal community involvement in Polkadot forums or events, no record of any on-chain participation, no involvement in StackExchange
* **3-4 points**: Sporadic on-chain participation, regular participation in Polkadot forums, attended an event or two, answered or asked a question or two on StackExchange
* **5-6 points**: Some documented evidence of influence in the community, frequently participates in Polkadot forums, regularly answers questions on StackExchange, a consistent track-record of on-chain participation
* **7-8 points**: Active on-chain participation, a leadership role at Polkadot community events, continually present on Polkadot forums and/or StackExchange 
* **9-10 points**: A recognized leader in the community, a highly active on-chain voter, high impact contributions on StackExchange and/or the Polkadot forums

### Content Creation Experience

* **0-2 points**: The candidate has no content creation experience on anything of a technical nature
* **3-4 points**: Minimal content creation with a few technical blog posts or videos
* **5-6 points**: Documented experience in creating content regularly of a technical nature, perhaps focusing on a single modality of content, i.e. blogs or videos
* **7-8 points**: A wide range of content creation history, including recent content, across a diverse array of modalities and the content consistently has a strong technical focus with code samples
* **9-10 points**: Extensive content creation experience with a particular focus on Polkadot and Web3 technologies and most of the content has accompanying code examples, sample applications, etc.  

### Leadership Experience

* **0-2 points**: No experience documented of leading any tech related meetups or community groups, or evidence of a single experience taking part in an event committee or similar type of involvement; no or minimal contributions to Polkadot forums or other online discussions; no involvement in mentorship of others
* **3-4 points**: Beginning involvement in leadership of a technical event or a technical community, not necessarily blockchain or Polkadot related; A couple of contributions to Polkadot forums, StackExchange or similar online discussions, minimal or beginning mentorship experience with others in Polkadot or another technical community
* **5-6 points**: Regular participation in Polkadot online discussions and forums, answers provided on StackExchange, participation in leadership of a Polkadot event or online community, mentorship experience with other people in the Polkadot community or other technical communities
* **7-8 points**: Active leadership in Polkadot related events, regularly providing answers on StackExchange and many of them chosen as the solution to the question being asked, a mentorship role in the Polkadot community or other technical communities
* **9-10 points**: Prominent participation in Polkadot forums and StackExchange, with documented evidence of shaping the discourse on the forums and solving many questions on StackExchange; Consistent and active leadership in significant Polkadot community events, a mentor of not only others but also a mentor to other mentors in the Polkadot community or other technical communities
