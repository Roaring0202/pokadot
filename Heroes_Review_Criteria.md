# Developer Heroes Application Review Criteria and Scoring Guidelines

If you want to become a Hero in the Polkadot Developer Heroes program, you are at the right place. The following process is used to evaluate a candidate for Hero status.

## Process

Each candidate is scored based on proof(s) of work in four areas. These areas encompass the core competencies a hero is expected to have to varying degrees to be part of the program as a Hero. These areas are:


* **Technical expertise**: Are they active contributors to the Polkadot ecosystem, with code contributions, educational efforts, documentation work, technical publications, do they have a strong presence on StackExchange?
* **Community involvement**: Are they highly engaged in the Polkadot community, actively participating in various ways such as forum contributions, event attendance, hackathon participation and wins, mentoring in the Heroes program, holding an ambassador role, or are they contributing to community moderation?
* **Content creation experience**: Have they contributed significantly to the Polkadot community through technical blog posts, interactive educational content, videos, podcast appearances, (multilingual) educational materials, infographics, or public speaking engagements at Polkadot-related events?

* **Leadership experience**: Are they deeply involved in leading the Polkadot community, organizing events, leading projects, judging or mentoring at hackathons, or possibly managing a Polkadot-focused publications?

The team reviews nominations on a rolling basis. Review cadence might change in the future, depending on number of nominations received. 
We commit to responding to every nomination within two weeks after receiving the nomination.

## Scoring Framework

Evaluation will be based on the following criteria and questions. The scoring framework should assist the evaluators in providing a reasoned score for each category for the candidate.
Candidates need to first meet one of four criteria, which assesses their coding skills. Then candidates will be evaluated based on a comprehensive evaluation framework. **The framework has a maximum of 51 points.** 

<mark>Those candidates that score 25 or more points will be promoted from Rookie to Hero.</mark>

*Note: The total number of points and scoring limit for requirements are subject to change in the future.*


## Scoring Criteria


To qualify as a Hero, a Candidate must meet at least one of the following criteria:

- They have made contributions to the code of the Polkadot SDK repository (Polkadot, Substrate, Cumulus) by having more than one merged pull request in the past quarter.
- They have contributed code to more than one merged pull request in an open-source Substrate-based chain project. 
*If this is not an open source project, please reach out to us separately to walk us through the commits.*
- They have contributed substantial code to more than one merged pull request in a widely used open-source library or tool within the Polkadot ecosystem.
*This may be e.g. libp2p, rust, WASM, etc.* 
- They have contributed substantial code to more than one merged pull request in a dapp within the Polkadot ecosystem.

*Note: for these contributions we need to see code contributions that affect the functionality, such as bug fixes, features improvements, or performance optimization changes. Grammatical or stylistical changes that do not affect any functionality do not count here.*

Furthermore, points can be collected via the following criteria, if the candidate:
